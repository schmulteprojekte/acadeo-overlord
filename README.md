# 🤖 Server

## Setup

### Secrets

```env
APP_NAME="my-overlord"
ACCESS_KEYS='["example-secret-key-one", "example-secret-key-two", "example-secret-key-three"]'
ALLOWED_ORIGINS='["https://www.example.com/"]'
RATE_LIMITS='["1/second", "10/minute", "100/day"]'

# various langfuse project keys
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY_PROJECT="your-langfuse-secret-key-with-the-project-name"
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY_PROJECT="your-langfuse-public-key-with-the-project-name"

# various ai provider api keys
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
```

### Deployment

#### Local

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`uvicorn main:app --no-access-log`

#### Cloud

Simply utilize the `Dockerfile` to automatically install all dependencies.

### Usage

Currently there only is a Python client available for server to server communication.

The Overlord API is based on server-sent events (SSE), meaning by simply sending requests to the `ai/chat` endpoint and parsing SSE one could access the API easily and build their own client for front-end usage in e.g. JavaScript etc.

# 😊 Client

## Setup

### Installation

Copy `client.py` to your cwd

Rename to `overlordapi.py`

Run `pip install requests pydantic`

## Usage

```python
from overlordapi import Overlord


overlord = Overlord("http://your-server.url", "your-api-key", "your-langfuse-project")

# health check (optional)
print(overlord.client.ping().text)
```

### Input

The API can be called with either a prompt from Langfuse or a simple text prompt.
Every chat must however start with a Langfuse prompt, as model settings are derived from it.

```python
class ChatInput(BaseModel):
    prompt: str | dict
    file_urls: list[str] = []  # optional
    metadata: dict = {}  # custom

# overlord.input internalizes this schema
```

#### Langfuse prompt

Here are the internalized models shown to visualize the dictionary structure required by ChatInput's prompt.

```python
class PromptArgs(BaseModel):
    name: str
    label: str  # defaults to 'production'
    version: str | None = None


class PromptConfig(BaseModel):
    args: PromptArgs
    placeholders: dict = {}  # optional
    project: str  # this is used internally and can be ignored
```

```python
data = overlord.input(
    prompt=dict(
        args=dict(
            name="summarize_file",
            label="latest",
        ),
        placeholders=dict(
            role="professor",
        ),
    ),
    file_urls=["https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf"],
    metadata=dict(
        order_id="123456",
    ),
)
```

#### Simple text prompt

As mentioned earlier the chat can be continued with a simple text prompt but must always start with a Langfuse prompt.

```python
data = overlord.input(prompt="What did we just look at?")
```

### Requests

#### Single task
```python
response = overlord.task(data)
```

#### Persistent chat
```python
chat = overlord.chat()

# check session id (optional)
print(chat.session_id)

response = chat.request(data)
```

## Notes
- every chat will have its own session id used to connect messages in the Langfuse UI
- the initally provided system prompt json schema from the first Langfuse prompt is used throughout a chat
